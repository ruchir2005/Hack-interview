AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform

This project is a full-stack, AI-powered mock interview platform designed to help users prepare for job interviews. It simulates a realistic interview experience by dynamically generating questions and interview rounds based on a user's role and company of interest. The platform is built with a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend, with its core logic powered by the Gemini API.
Completed Work
Backend (Python & FastAPI)

The backend serves as the brain of the application, handling all communication with the Gemini AI.

    API Endpoints: Implemented endpoints to start-interview and submit-answer.

    Dynamic Interview Plan Generation: The backend uses Gemini to create a multi-round interview plan tailored to a specific job role and company.

    AI-Powered Question Generation: It generates unique, context-specific questions for each round, including:

        Behavioral Questions

        Technical Questions

        Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for online assessments.

    Session Management: The backend manages the state of each interview session, tracking the user's progress through rounds and questions.

Backend File Descriptions

    main.py: The core of the backend. This file initializes the FastAPI server, configures the Gemini API, and defines all the API endpoints (/api/start-interview and /api/submit-answer). It contains the GeminiService class, which handles all the AI-powered generation logic for interview plans and questions.

Frontend (Next.js & React)

The frontend provides a clean and intuitive user interface for the mock interview experience.

    Resume Upload Page: A form-based page to collect essential user information (resume, job role, company, years of experience).

    Dynamic Interview Page: The page adapts in real-time to display the current interview round title and the question generated by the backend. It handles user input and sends it to the API.

    Loading & Error States: Includes visual feedback with loading spinners and error messages to inform the user of the application's status.

Frontend File Descriptions

    pages/interview.tsx: This is the primary page component for the interview flow. It manages the state of the interview (e.g., current question, session ID), makes API calls to the backend, and dynamically renders the interview questions and input fields.

    pages/_app.tsx: This file is the entry point for the Next.js application. It wraps all pages and can be used for global layouts or state management across the entire application.

    pages/layout.tsx: This file defines the global layout for the Next.js application, such as the main container and overall styling that is shared across all pages.

Core Technologies

    Backend: Python, FastAPI, Gemini API

    Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS

Getting Started

To run the application, you need to start both the backend server and the frontend application in separate terminal windows.
1. Run the Backend

Navigate to the AI_MOCK_INTERVIEW/interview-backend directory, activate your Python virtual environment, and start the FastAPI server.

cd AI_MOCK_INTERVIEW/interview-backend
uvicorn main:app --reload


2. Run the Frontend

In a new terminal, navigate to the AI_MOCK_INTERVIEW/ai-mock-web directory and start the Next.js development server.

cd AI_MOCK_INTERVIEW/ai-mock-web
npm run dev


The application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
Next Steps

While the core functionality is complete, the following features are planned to enhance the platform:

    Coding Rounds: Integrate a code editor (like Monaco) for technical questions that require writing and submitting code.

    AI Feedback & Scoring: Use Gemini to evaluate user answers and provide constructive feedback and a score for each question.

    Resume/Job Description Parsing: Implement AI-powered parsing to extract skills and keywords from the resume to generate more personalized questions.
